# Credit Card Fraud Detection System ##

## Overview
This machine learning project is designed to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced analytical techniques. 
The initiative addresses the challenge of imbalanced data classification, where fraudulent transactions represent a small percentage of total transactions, 
while demonstrating effective approaches to handle such datasets through various machine learning algorithms and performance evaluation methods.


## Key Goals
  Develop robust machine learning models capable of distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate credit card transactions

  Implement effective strategies for managing imbalanced datasets where fraud cases are significantly outnumbered by legitimate transactions

  Evaluate and compare the effectiveness of multiple classification algorithms including:

  1. Logistic Regression

  2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

  3. Decision Tree Classifier

  4. K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN)


## Technology Framework
  Programming Language : Python
  Core Libraries: scikit-learn for machine learning, NumPy for numerical computations, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
  Development Platform: Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and analysis
